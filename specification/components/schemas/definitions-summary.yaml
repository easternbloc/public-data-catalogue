    title: Title
    description: Title of the dataset limited to 80 characters. It should provide
          a short description of the dataset and be unique across the gateway. If
          your title is not unique, please add a prefix with your organisation name
          or identifier to differentiate it from other datasets within the Gateway.
          Please avoid acronyms wherever possible. Good titles should summarise the
          content of the dataset and if relevant, the region the dataset covers.

    - - North West London COVID-19 Patient Level Situation Report

    title: Dataset Abstract
    description: Provide a clear and brief descriptive signpost for researchers
          who are searching for data that may be relevant to their research. The abstract
          should allow the reader to determine the scope of the data collection and
          accurately summarise its content. The optimal length is one paragraph (limited
          to 255 characters) and effective abstracts should avoid long sentences and
          abbreviations where possible
    # "$comment": dct:abstract
    example:
        - CPRD Aurum contains primary care data contributed by General Practitioner
          (GP) practices using EMIS Web® including patient registration information
          and all care events that GPs have chosen to record as part of their usual
          medical practice.

  #   title: Dataset publisher
  #   description: This is the organisation responsible for running or supporting
  #         the data access request process, as well as publishing and maintaining the
  #         metadata. In most this will be the same as the HDR UK Organisation (Hub
  #         or Alliance Member). However, in some cases this will be different i.e.
  #         Tissue Directory are an HDR UK Gateway organisation but coordinate activities
  #         across a number of data publishers i.e. Cambridge Blood and Stem Cell Biobank.

          data access requests with the publisher. Organisations are expected to provide
          a dedicated email address associated with the data access request process.
          Notes: An employee’s email address can only be provided on a temporary basis
