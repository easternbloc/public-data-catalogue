    title: Title
    description: Title of the dataset limited to 80 characters. It should provide
          a short description of the dataset and be unique across the gateway. If
          your title is not unique, please add a prefix with your organisation name
          or identifier to differentiate it from other datasets within the Gateway.
          Please avoid acronyms wherever possible. Good titles should summarise the
          content of the dataset and if relevant, the region the dataset covers.

    title: Dataset Abstract
    description: Provide a clear and brief descriptive signpost for researchers
          who are searching for data that may be relevant to their research. The abstract
          should allow the reader to determine the scope of the data collection and
          accurately summarise its content. The optimal length is one paragraph (limited
          to 255 characters) and effective abstracts should avoid long sentences and
          abbreviations where possible

          medical practice.

    title: Dataset publisher
    description: This is the organisation responsible for running or supporting
          the data access request process, as well as publishing and maintaining the
          metadata. In most this will be the same as the HDR UK Organisation (Hub
          or Alliance Member). However, in some cases this will be different i.e.
          Tissue Directory are an HDR UK Gateway organisation but coordinate activities
          across a number of data publishers i.e. Cambridge Blood and Stem Cell Biobank.
