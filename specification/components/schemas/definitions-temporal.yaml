    description: 'Please indicate the frequency of distribution release. If a
          dataset is distributed regularly please choose a distribution release periodicity
          from the constrained list and indicate the next release date. When the release
          date becomes historical, a new release date will be calculated based on
          the publishing periodicity. If a dataset has been published and will remain
          static please indicate that it is static and indicated when it was released.
          If a dataset is released on an irregular basis or “on-demand” please indicate
          that it is Irregular and leave release date as null. If a dataset can be
          published in real-time or near-real-time please indicate that it is continuous
          and leave release date as null. Notes: see https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/collection-description/frequency/'

          when the next release is expected. E.g. if the release date is documented
          as 01/01/2020 and it is now 20/04/2020 and there is a quarterly release
          schedule, the latest release will be calculated as 01/04/2020.'
